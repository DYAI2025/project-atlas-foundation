// ATLAS-40 slice 2: the pointer drag state machine.
//
// The defect this file exists for: after a drag crossed the movement threshold,
// a pointercancel left the click suppression armed. A cancelled pointer never
// delivers the click the suppression was waiting for, so the armed flag was
// spent on the NEXT, unrelated click — the user presses something and the
// application ignores them once, with nothing on screen to explain why.
//
// Slice 1 could only assert that app.mjs still contained the string
// "suppressClick = true". That is exactly why this shipped.
